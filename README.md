An experimental program that launches the camera in the browser and adds a timestamp signature to the PDF.

While AI is reducing the evidential value of photos, the concept is to create evidential photos by generating timestamp-signed PDFs directly within the browser.

To enhance evidential value, embedding additional information such as the browser details and location data from the time of capture could also be considered.
